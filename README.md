# jf_looper (scaffold)

4‑bar audio looper for Norns + Monome Grid 128, driven entirely by Softcut.

* **Transport** – K2 start/stop, K3 panic.  
* **Grid**  
  * Columns 1‑6: tap = play/mute, hold = arm‑record (replace)  
  * Columns 11‑16: vertical level faders for loops 1‑6  
* **Screen** – single progress ring showing position in global 4‑bar cycle  
* **Persistence** – XML in `dust/data/jf_looper/projects/<name>/` + `jf_looper_autoload.txt`  

This repo is a stub; flesh out recording, XML deserialize, and project chooser UI.
